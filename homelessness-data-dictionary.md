## Data Dictionary

|  Metric | Description  | Calculation Method  | Source  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|**Age Groups Served**  | Breaks down participant age ranges into youth (0-17), transitional aged youth (18-24), adults (25-61) and elderly (62 and over).  | Evaluates a program participant's age based on their first enrollment and assigns the person to the appropriate age group. The calculation for the chart is the sum of program participants for each age group. Does not include counts for any applicant whose age was not known during their first enrollment.  | Long Beach HMIS  |
|**Average Age** | Average age of program participants at enrollment.  | Average age for all enrollments filtered by program enrollment type.  | Long Beach HMIS
|**Median Length (days) of Participants with Successful Exits** | Shows the median number of days spent in a program before a successful exit. Data is shown over time to display trends.   | Median value of days spent in program for individuals enrolled in *Permanent Housing* or *Interim Housing* programs, grouped by Exit year. Exits can happen over a long period of time. Our dataset only has data from 2018 onwards. This means the maximum days for 2018 Exits is 365 just due to the data being truncated at 2018. Therefore, we put the label of "Insufficient Data". 2023 has just started and so have the exits in 2023. The other years had an average over an entire year of potential exits while 2023 only has a couple months. Therefore, we also put a label of "Insufficient Data". | Long Beach HMIS
|**Median Program Stay in Days** | Median number of days spent in a program.  | Grabs the median of participants' "Days in Program Stay" value for a given program. Under the same considerations as "Median Length (days) of Participants with Successful Exits".   | Long Beach HMIS

|**Exit Destinations for Interim/Permanent Housing Program Participants** | Describes where a program participant went after exiting a program using category groupings. These values are unique to the program exit, not to the individual. Click on a grouping to see the granular destinations in the accompanying Update/Exit Screen Destination table. | Sum of program exit destinations, grouped by exit destination category. Currently enrolled individuals are listed under "Enrolled". If a location was unknown/blank then they were set as "No exit interview completed". | Long Beach HMIS

Alternatively, an individual could have moved in to the permanent housing which is recorded as the "Housing Move-in Date" as per HUD [3.20](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HMIS-Data-Standards-Manual.pdf) If a person is currently enrolled then they are also given a value of "Exclude" unless they have a "Housing Move-in Date".   | Long Beach HMIS

|**Program Enrollments Over Time**  | Count of program enrollments for individuals broken down by type (Interim Housing, Permanent Housing, and Support Services) shown over time in quarters. For example, a person receiving Interim Housing and Support Services in 2022 Q2 would appear once in the Interim Housing count and once in the Support Services count respectively.
