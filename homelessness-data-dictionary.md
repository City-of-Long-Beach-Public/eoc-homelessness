## Data Dictionary

### Overview

|  Metric | Description  | Calculation Method  | Source  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|**Age Groups Served**  | Breaks down participant age ranges into youth (0-17), transitional aged youth (18-24), adults (25-61) and elderly (62 and over).  | Evaluates a program participant's age based on their first enrollment and assigns the person to the appropriate age group. The calculation for the chart is the sum of program participants for each age group. Does not include counts for any applicant whose age was not known during their first enrollment.  | Long Beach HMIS  |
|**Average Age** | Average age of program participants at enrollment.  | Average age for all enrollments filtered by program enrollment type.  | Long Beach HMIS
|**Case Management Sessions Conducted**  | Number of case management sessions conducted.  | Count of all services where the Service Name is *Case Management* or *Case Management Services*. | Long Beach HMIS  |
|**Destinations / Outcome** | Describes where a program participant went after exiting a program using category groupings. These values are unique to the program exit, not to the individual. | Sum of program exit destinations. Enrollments that are currently active are not included. If a destination was unknown/blank in our HMIS, then their destination was set to "No exit interview completed". | Long Beach HMIS
|**Gender**  | Program participant gender.  | Sum of male and female participants, respectively. Participants who did not answer the question, those whose gender is not known, or those who select "Transgender", "A gender other than singularly female or male (e.g., non-binary, genderfluid, agender, culturally specific gender)", or "Questioning" appear as "Gender Expansive or Declined". | Long Beach HMIS  |
|**Median Days to Obtain Permanent Housing** | Shows the median number of days spent in a program before a Permanent Housing Outcome. Individuals who exit the program are given an exit survey to show where they are heading to. This is translated to positive or negative outcomes by HUDs [performance metric guidance](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/System-Performance-Measure-7-Housing-Destination-Summary.pdf). Alternatively, an individual could have moved in to the permanent housing which is recorded as the "Housing Move-in Date" as per HUD [3.20](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HMIS-Data-Standards-Manual.pdf) If a person is currently enrolled then they are also given a value of "Exclude" unless they have a "Housing Move-in Date".  Data is shown over time to display trends.   | Median value of days spent in program for individuals enrolled in *Permanent Housing* or *Interim Housing* programs, grouped by Exit year. Exits can happen over a long period of time. Our dataset only has data from 2018 onwards. This means the maximum days for 2018 Exits is 365 just due to the data being truncated at 2018. Therefore, we put the label of "Insufficient Data". 2023 has just started and so have the exits in 2023. The other years had an average over an entire year of potential exits while 2023 only has a couple months. Therefore, we also put a label of "Insufficient Data". | Long Beach HMIS

For example, a person receiving Interim Housing and Support Services in 2022 Q2 would appear once in the Interim Housing count and once in the Support Services count respectively. If the same person received 10 incidents of Support Services in 2022 Q3 they would only appear once in the Support Services because the calculation is based on unique individual enrollments.  | Count of unique individuals enrolled in each program type (*Interim Housing, Permanent Housing, Support Services*) per quarter  | Long Beach HMIS  |
