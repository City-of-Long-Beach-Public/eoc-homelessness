|**Reports/Requests from Public Leading to Encampment Visits**  | The call system accepts calls and emails. All the requests are categorized with what the call was about.

|**Percent of People Who Remain Housed**  | Uses the same calculation as in "Median Days to Obtain Permanent Housing" to determine the outcome of an enrollment. A permanent outcome is then a case where a "person remains housed" since they already had permanent housing to get into the program. It is turned into a percentage by dividing by the total number of enrollments without the people who should be excluded as defined by [HUD](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/System-Performance-Measure-7-Housing-Destination-Summary.pdf "HUD") | Divide the total number of permanent outcomes by the number of "non-excluded" outcomes | Long Beach HMIS |

### Outcomes

|  Metric | Description  | Calculation Method  | Source  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|**Average Age** | Average age of program participants at enrollment.  | Average age for all enrollments filtered by program enrollment type.  | Long Beach HMIS |
|**Destinations / Outcome** | Describes where a program participant went after exiting a program using category groupings.

Alternatively, an individual could have moved in to the permanent housing which is recorded as the "Housing Move-in Date" as per HUD [3.20](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HMIS-Data-Standards-Manual.pdf) If a person is currently enrolled then they are also given a value of "Exclude" unless they have a "Housing Move-in Date".  Data is shown over time to display trends.   | Median value of days spent in program for individuals enrolled in *Permanent Housing* or *Interim Housing* programs, grouped by Exit year. Exits can happen over a long period of time. Our dataset only has data from 2018 onwards. This means the maximum days for 2018 Exits is 365 just due to the data being truncated at 2018. Therefore, we put the label of "Insufficient Data". 2023 has just started and so have the exits in 2023. The other years had an average over an entire year of potential exits while 2023 only has a couple months. Therefore, we also put a label of "Insufficient Data". | Long Beach HMIS |
